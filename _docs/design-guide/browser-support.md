For CSS and JS (and anything else relevent to run on a web page) we support the following:

| Browser | OS |  Versions  |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Google Chrome | Windows / OS X | Current and last previous version |
| Google Chrome | Android | Current and last previous version |
| Apple Safari | OS X | Current and last previous version |
| Apple Safari | iOS | Current and last previous version |
| Firefox | Windows / OS X | Current and last previous version |
| Micosoft Edge | Windows | Current and last previous version |
| Micosoft Internet Explorer | Windows | 11 only |

*Current and previous version would mean, for example if the current version was 56, we would support versions 56 (current) and 55 (previous), but not 54, 53, 52 or beta versions 57
