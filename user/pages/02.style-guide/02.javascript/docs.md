### CSS

+ Try to only ever use shorcuts for selectors such as `padding`, `margin` and `border`
```
// good
padding: 0 5px 10px 2px;
//bad
padding-left: 10px;
```
+ Somehting else

### Media queries

+ Only ever use `min-width`, never `max-width`
+ Write your selectors mobile first, in **ascending order of size**. eg a style that applies to every size screen goes first, one that is `min-width: 992px` comes after
